It consists of following independ C programs.

1. pwm_motor.c  (Local Socket Server)
	Receive command from Local Socket Client and ajust speed(through PWM) and direction for the motor accordingly.
	Send PWM value of the motor to the actuator(SG) through message queue.

2. mouse_motorctl.c  (Local Socket Client)
	Use mouse to ajust PWM threshold and send the value to pwm_motor.c throuhg local socket.

3. pwm_actuator.c
	Receive command from message queue and set PWM for the actuator(SG).

4. ipc_ctlmotor.c
	A test for local socket client contorl


Note:
 	1. Run pwm_actuator first, then pwm_motor and ipc_ctlmotor(or mouse_ctlmotor) to test.
	2. See the block diagram pciture for reference.
